Project Title:
Custom Outdoor Kitchen & Pergola Ordering Platform with Live Supplier Inventory

Project Description:
We are building a web-based platform that allows customers to order outdoor kitchens and pergolas based only on live stock availability from our manufacturers in China. The site will serve as a B2C frontend and a backend automation system that routes each order directly to the correct supplier for fulfillment.

Our role is to receive orders, validate supplier stock, and facilitate DDP shipping directly to the customer’s address. The platform will only display products and configurations that are currently available in stock from one or more manufacturers.

Core Features:
🛍️ Live Product Catalogue (Stock-Based):
Display only in-stock outdoor kitchen and pergola models (via supplier feed/API or manual sync)

Group products by:

Type (e.g., modular kitchen, built-in grill unit, pergola)

Dimensions and layout options (L-shape, island, straight)

Available materials/finishes

Show current stock levels, estimated shipping times, and originating supplier

Allow multiple suppliers with clearly assigned products

🧰 Product Customisation (Conditional):
Allow limited customisation based on available modules from stock (not full design-your-own)

For example:

Add-ons like sink units, fridge cabinets, drawer sets

Pergola options: size, side panels, louvered roof, motorised/manual
